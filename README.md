# cs441-multipleScreens

I created an app for all the cats in my life. The main screen shows one image of each cat and lets you choose who is your favorite. To help you decide on your favorite, you can click an image of one of the cats, which goes to a different view controller with this cat's name and more images. Also, the new view controller reminds you if you chose this cat as your favorite. Sharing data across view controllers was my biggest challenge here.
